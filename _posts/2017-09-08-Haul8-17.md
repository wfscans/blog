Along with doing reviews of stuff now and then(and the rambles I finally having a solid home for) I'll also be posting my monthly Hauls of stuff I buy(well when I buy things that is). For the month of August I actually got a lot more then I normally would. Well I'm sure it helps that one of them is a semi birthday present(only had to pay for half of it). As you can see above I picked up [Not Lives](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=67910) volume 6 by Karasuma Wataru and translated by Seven Seas Entertainment.

Secondly is this collection of Monogatari artbooks. If I recall their is another set of these but they cost a lot more. I'd like to collect them as well but I'll to do it at a slower pace. Anyway here is the 8 book set. Nadeko's actually includes a manga "written" and "drawn" by her. If I recall correctly it's the manga that Kaiki finds in her closet. It also fits her theme seeing as it looks exactly like a manga mag you'd buy at the store. 

You can't see it because the slip cover thing is covering it but the Fire Sisters are holding(respectively) a toothbrush and a normal brush. I'm not sure if they were going for a sort of pun in both being brushes but I'd like to think Tsukihi would be much better off with a pry bar.

Lastly I ended up buying the [Kanpani Girls anthology](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4048927906) released at the end of the month. I might not whale but I can't not get a good anthology. I also got the last two volumes of Douman Seiman's work [Nickelodeon](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=58407). Between this and Voynich Hotel I'd say they're probably his most known works(at least in the English speaking community). In the future I plan to collect more of his works. Of course I'm also following along with his new work ["How Many Light-Years to Babylon?"](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=138840).
