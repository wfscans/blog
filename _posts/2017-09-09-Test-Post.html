<p><b>TLDR: Yeah, it actually turned out okay and if you don’t want to read the novel this is a good alternative as it’s read to you.</b></p>


<p>So recently I listened to the Kizumonogatari audiobook done by Vertical. I have to say I’m surprised it came out better than I ever expected it to be. Maybe that in itself was what made the experience so positive? By not expecting much I was able to come away with more… well either way I’ll let you be the judge, let’s get on with the review of sorts. Though before we get started for anyone who hasn’t read Kizu(or at least watched the movies) this does include spoilers for Kizu. If you plan to read or listen then I’d suggest refering to the TDLR, read through the book, and come back and see how we compare on the voices and such.</p>


<p>Kizumonogatari taking place as the third book in the series, it covers Araragi’s nightmarish spring break taking place right after his 1st year in highschool ends and right before the faithful 2nd year starts. If I were to sum up the story of Kizumonogatari in one sentence it’d be something like this - Koyomi Araragi is just your average high schooler who just so happened to have an encounter that would change his life forever. Now maybe I’m over simplifying that but it’s certainly true. But enough about the story itself, let’s focus more so on the topic at hand… the audiobook.</p>


<p>So I’m sure you're wondering about the elephant in the room… Monogatari with an English dub. Well in this case they’ve be able to sidestep a major issue. That being having to match the speed of dialogue and lip flaps of the animation. Of course picking the Kizumonogatari movies wouldn’t actually be as bad as the normal series due to it’s much slower pacing and lack of dialogue(in movie form) but I digress. Compared to just reading the novel, the audiobook brings forth new life to the story through music, sound effects, and voice actors portraying different roles. That’s right, this isn’t someone reading a book but more so of an audio drama. Overall I felt the voice work was quite good, though at times it can fall flat. To go more indepth on this I’d like to break it down by character.</p>

<p>Arararagi(sorry I stuttered). So first up on our list is of course the man himself, voiced by Erik Kimerer who you may know as the English voice of Ryuuji(Toradora). For the most part they did a good job portraying his Araragi… but of course there were also times where they just fall flat. For example the best scene throughout the entire book is at the start when he first meets Kiss shot. Both do an excellent job acting out the scene in a way that could possibly be close to standing up with the Japanese version(Especially on his scream). Of course there are also times where he plan out falls flat… like in the Shed scene(which by the way has way more meaning in the book then in the movie). Maybe if Hanekawa’s VA was also flat it’d be even the tiniest bit less awkward(actually that make it worse) but as you can see that didn’t happen.</p>

<p>* Owari on <span class=”spoiler”>So listening to Kiss Shot’s explanation of the aberration killer sword being able to kill an aberration without harming the former(say a human). I can now confirm Shinobu being gone in parts of Owari and in Hana(and anything between this) due to the events of Koyomimonogatari. Damn I really feel bad for the people who did offical only watches… must be quite confused with Owari Part 2…</span></p>
